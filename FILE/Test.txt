Language is the foundation of humanity. 
Our ability to communicate gives us both empathy and a sense of self.
With increasing globalization comes the need for greater access to language.
Luckily, recent advancements in tech have allowed learning opportunities to catch up with the growing demand.
Linguistic education has historically been a face-to-face endeavor, with careful practice physically overseen by an instructor. 
But as education moves online, learning a language is now more convenient and affordable than ever. 
Services such as Duolingo and Rosetta Stone offer on-the-go digital language learning, providing instantaneous language education that functions somewhat like a game.
However, these systems are not the only alternative methods for learning a language quickly. 
Others combine the practicality of online learning with the dynamic interactions of in-person education.
